# Calculator_using_DLD

Project Overview üõ†Ô∏è
The project aims to develop a sophisticated processor for a calculator, capable of executing a predefined set of commands efficiently. The processor will feature inputs for clock pulses, command availability, the command itself, and input data, along with outputs for output availability and data.

To implement the processor, a blend of digital logic concepts including combinational logic, sequential logic, and state machines will be employed. Combinational logic involves logic gates that amalgamate inputs to produce a single output, while sequential logic circuits store and utilize information over time. State machines dictate the behavior of digital systems by defining states and their transitions.

In the project, flip-flops will store values of A and B, while combinational logic gates will decode commands and generate control signals for the state machine. The state machine, realized through a combination of flip-flops and logic gates, will execute commands based on inputs. The output register will store output data, and output enable logic will signal output availability.

These concepts hold significance as they offer a structured approach to designing digital circuits and systems. Through combinational and sequential logic, intricate operations can be implemented using fundamental elements like logic gates and flip-flops. State machines provide organization to digital systems, streamlining design, analysis, and testing processes.
